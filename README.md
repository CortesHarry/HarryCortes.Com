# HarryCortes.Com


Source code for harrycortes.com. Written in HTML and CSS. 

Independent project that I started. Began as a way to imporve my HTML/CSS skills. Eventually I decided that I indeed liked the way it was presented to the guest, and decided to launch it. Currently it is being hosted online. 

HarryCortes.com evolved from a learning venture, to an indepentdent project, to a "portfolio" of sorts.
