            Hello, and welcome to harrycortes.com. Iâ€™m Harry Cortes! I am a student based out of New York City, as well as an aspiring software developer. 
            <br><br>
            Having been born and raised in the South Bronx, it has given me a unique perspective to life, I believe. The South Bronx helped to nurture my compassion. It stoked the flames of my ambition. I went on to study Computer Science and Chemistry with a concentration in Mathematics at the City University of New York Brooklyn College. It was a rigorous nine semesters. I never took less than five classes, and I had at least one job every semester. Most semesters I had two, and some I had three. Sleep was a distant friend. I went on to intern as an Information Technalist for the Research Foundation of CUNY. The program placed me in the Bronx Center for Science and Mathematics. It was the most rewarding experience of my life thus far. Everything from the vast amounts of expertise it permitted me, to the amazing people I met. Currently I spend my time split between my part-time job at the Gap, my last semester at Brooklyn College, and personal projects.
