            Hello, and welcome to harrycortes.com. Iâ€™m Harry Cortes! I am a student based out of New York City, as well as an aspiring software developer. 
            <br><br>
            Having been born and raised in the South Bronx, it has given me a unique perspective to life, I believe. The South Bronx helped to nurture my compassion. It stoked the flames of my ambition.
            <br><br>
            I went on to study Computer Science and Chemistry with a concentration in Mathematics at the City University of New York Brooklyn College. It was a rigorous nine semesters. I never took less than five classes, and I had at least one job every semester. Most semesters I had two, and some I had three. Sleep was my <i>high school</i> friend, not my college friend. 
            <br><br>
            During my time at Brooklyn College I was accepted by the Brooklyn College Speechlab to be a part of their research project: Bubbles. It was loosely inspired by the Stanford project of the same name. The program targets fine-grained recognition methods that are used by humans so that we can relate them to computers. I helped in coding, and setting up the database. We used NodeJS, Java, and SQL. While Stanford focused on the visual sense, we placed the spotlight on the auditory sense. To this day the BC Speechlab is still developing the research. 
            <br><br>
            I went on to intern as an Information Technalist for the Research Foundation of CUNY. The program placed me in the Bronx Center for Science and Mathematics. It was the most rewarding experience of my life thus far. Everything from the vast amounts of expertise it permitted me, to the amazing people I met. 
            <br><br>
            Currently I spend my time split between my part-time job at the Gap, my last semester at Brooklyn College, and personal projects.
